# LLM-generated skills

This directory contains skills automatically generated by the SkillBuilder.

Files in this directory are gitignored.

## Usage

Generated skills are automatically saved here by the SkillBuilder:

```typescript
import { SkillBuilder, SkillSerializer } from 'skills';

const builder = new SkillBuilder(apiClient);
const skill = await builder.buildSkill(request);

// Save to generated directory
const serializer = new SkillSerializer();
const markdown = serializer.serialize(skill);
await fs.writeFile(
  `./libs/skills/repository/generated/${skill.name}.skill.md`,
  markdown
);
```

## Review Process

1. Generated skills should be reviewed and tested
2. If satisfactory, move to `user/` directory
3. If stable and useful for team, move to `builtin/`
