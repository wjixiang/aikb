# Skills Repository

This directory contains skill definitions in markdown format.

## Directory Structure

```
repository/
├── builtin/          # Built-in skills (version controlled)
├── user/             # User-created skills (gitignored)
└── generated/        # LLM-generated skills (gitignored)
```

## Builtin Skills

Built-in skills are maintained by the project team and version controlled.

Examples:
- `paper-analysis.skill.md` - Paper analysis utilities
- `reviewing-r1-r2.skill.md` - Paper review R1-R2 methodology
- `writing.skill.md` - Academic writing workflow

## User Skills

User-created skills are stored here and should be gitignored to avoid conflicts.

## Generated Skills

Skills automatically generated by the LLM-driven builder are stored here.
These can be reviewed, tested, and promoted to user or builtin skills.

## Loading Skills

```typescript
import { SkillRegistry, SkillLoader } from 'skills';

const registry = new SkillRegistry();
const loader = new SkillLoader(registry);

// Load builtin skills
await loader.loadFromDirectory('./libs/skills/repository/builtin');

// Load user skills
await loader.loadFromDirectory('./libs/skills/repository/user');

// Load generated skills
await loader.loadFromDirectory('./libs/skills/repository/generated');
```

## Creating New Skills

1. Create a new `.skill.md` file in the appropriate directory
2. Follow the skill markdown format (see README.md)
3. Test the skill using SkillTestRunner
4. Evaluate using SkillEvaluator

## Skill Lifecycle

```
Generated → User → Builtin
   ↓         ↓       ↓
 (test)   (review) (stable)
```

1. **Generated**: Created by LLM, needs review
2. **User**: Reviewed and tested, personal use
3. **Builtin**: Stable, well-tested, shared with team
