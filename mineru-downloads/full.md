About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year—100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our uwnderstanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and fi ndings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfl uenza viruses are the agents identifi ed most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular infl uenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient’s age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help diff erentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral communityacquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by infl uenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specifi c antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Infl uenza vaccines are the only available specifi c preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional diff erences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.

# Introduction

Pneumonia is a common illness that continues to be the major killer of young children in developing countries and elderly people in developed countries. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, and now attention is turning to the importance of viruses as pathogens. Widespread introduction of Haemophilus infl uenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines into immunisation programmes has led to speculation about the growing predominance of viruses as causes of childhood pneumonia. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infl uenza A (H5N1) virus, and the 2009 pandemic infl uenza A (H1N1) virus has re-emphasised the important role of respiratory viruses as causes of severe pneumonia. New respiratory viruses—such as human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus—have been discovered during the past decade. Importantly, the availability of molecular diagnostic assays (such as PCR) has greatly increased our ability to detect and characterise the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies, in which conventional virological

# Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched PubMed for original research, reviews, and commentaries, with the terms “pneumonia and children/ adults”, “pneumonia and aetiology”, “viral pneumonia”, “pneumonia and viruses”, and names of specifi c respiratory viruses and pneumonia. No date or language restrictions were included. We paid special attention to reports published since 2000 when molecular diagnostics were introduced. We also searched our personal database of references gathered over the past 15 years and manually scanned references from selected reports and from selected authors.

diagnostic techniques were used, have most likely underestimated the role of viruses as pneumonia pathogens.1–5 In this Seminar, we review viral communityacquired pneumonia in immunocompetent children and adults, focusing on studies that have used modern molecular diagnostic techniques.

# Epidemiology of pneumonia

According to WHO estimates, 450 million cases of pneumonia are recorded every year; about 4 million people die from this illness, accounting for $7 \%$ of total mortality of 57 million people.6,7 The highest incidences arise in children younger than 5 years and in adults older than 75 years (fi gure 1).8 In developing countries, incidence could be fi ve times higher than in developed regions. In children, 156 million episodes of pneumonia are recorded annually, of which 151 million are present in developing countries.6,7 In 2008, 1·6 million children younger than 5 years died from pneumonia.9 5 million cases of childhood community-acquired pneumonia are reported yearly in developed countries, but mortality has declined strikingly and is now very rare. In a Canadian study, 25 319 admissions for childhood pneumonia took place during the 9-year study period; 11 deaths were recorded and only one death did not have a comorbid condition.10 Mortality of 1·2 per million previously healthy young adults has been recorded in the UK.11 In the USA alone, the economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia has been estimated to be more than US\$17 billion annually.12

# Diagnosis of viral pneumonia

Laboratory diagnosis of viral pneumonia has relied on detection of virus or viral antigen in upper-respiratory specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal aspirates) and lowerrespiratory samples (eg, induced sputum) by culture or immunofl uorescence microscopy, and on measurement of antibodies in paired serum samples. Introduction of PCR has increased the ability to detect respiratory viruses, including those that are diffi cult to culture. At least 26 viruses have now been associated with communityacquired pneumonia (panel).

Despite technological advances, establishing the cause of pneumonia remains challenging.13 Specimens from the lower-respiratory tract can be hard to obtain, and distinguishing possible prolonged shedding or colonisation from infection can be diffi cult. For diagnosis of viral pneumonia, reliance on testing of nasopharyngeal specimens presents its own challenges; detection of a virus in the nasopharynx could represent coincidental upper-respiratory infection or a pneumonia pathogen. Measurement of background prevalence of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal viral infection in a control group might help to clarify the size of this diagnostic issue at a population level, but this approach has been used only rarely in aetiological studies. Furthermore, most research has focused on patients admitted to hospital and, therefore, fi ndings might not be representative of mildto-moderate disease.

Several diff erent types of specimen from the upper and lower airway have been used in aetiological studies of community-acquired pneumonia, including: nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes; swabs from the nasopharynx, nose, or throat; combined nasopharygeal and throat swabs; expectorated and induced sputum; tracheal aspirates; bronchoalveolar lavage; and lung puncture.14,15 Recovery of virus fl uctuates according to specimen type, which probably accounts for some of the variability of fi ndings between studies.

Most studies of the cause of viral pneumonia have used upper-respiratory specimens to test for viruses. In children, nasopharyngeal aspirates are generally deemed the specimen of choice because both nasal and nasopharyngeal mucus samples are gathered. Respiratory viruses have been noted in $9 5 \%$ of mucus samples obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration from children with respiratory infection.16 Obtaining an aspirate is, however, unpleasant and requires a suction device. Nasal swabs taken with a sterile cotton swab from a depth of $2 - 3 \mathrm { c m }$ have comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates for culture of all major respiratory viruses, except respiratory syncytial virus.17 Flocked swabs with nylon fi bres in a perpendicular fashion are now preferred by many clinicians because they are convenient to use and have a similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates for detection by PCR of respiratory viruses.15,17,18 In adults, nasopharyngeal swabs have a higher sensitivity than throat swabs, but they can be less sensitive than nasopharyngeal washes.14 Transnasal nasopharyngeal fl ocked swabs also have high virus detection rates in adults.19,20

Lower-respiratory specimens have obvious advantages for establishing the cause of pneumonia because they come from the site of infection. However, obtaining

reliable specimens that are not contaminated by fl ora from the upper airway is diffi cult. Induced sputum specimens have been used in paediatric pneumonia studies, although assuring that the specimens are representative of the lower-respiratory tract can be challenging.21 High-quality specimens can be obtained by thoracic needle aspiration, but this technique has not been adopted widely because of safety concerns, despite a low complication rate.22,23

In general, PCR-based methods are between two and fi ve times more sensitive than conventional virus diagnostic methods (culture, antigen detection, and serological assays) for detection of respiratory viruses.

This benefi t applies particularly to adults and elderly people, who might have a smaller nasopharyngeal viral load than children.24,25 Moreover, some respiratory viruses can only be detected readily by PCR. Development of several multiplex assays has enabled simultaneous detection of up to 15 diff erent viruses, and use of these tests is becoming standard for identifi cation of respiratory viruses.26,27

The ability to diff erentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia could have important management implications. Despite advances, diagnostic tests still fail to identify causative agents in many aff ected individuals.28 As a result, other variables have been used to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia (table 1). However, no clinical algorithm exists to discern clearly the cause of pneumonia. This absence is perhaps not surprising in view of the probable important interaction between viruses and bacteria in pathogenesis of pneumonia.

Respiratory viruses usually follow seasonal patterns of activity and are most likely to cause pneumonia during those times. Epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus typically happen every or every other year in late autumn, rhinovirus epidemics arise in autumn and spring, whereas infl uenza peaks are seen during late autumn and early winter. Several viruses can be co-circulating at specifi c times of the year, even during the highest epidemic peaks of one virus.29

Although viral pneumonia is being recognised increasingly in adults, it still seems to be most typical in children, especially in infants younger than 2 years.30 According to the British Thoracic Society, fever higher than $3 8 \cdot 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , a respiratory rate greater than 50 breaths per min, and chest recession are suggestive of bacterial rather than viral pneumonia; by comparison, young age, wheezing, fever less than $3 8 \cdot 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and striking chest recession are suggestive of a viral cause.1 However, clinical signs and symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are highly variable and overlap; there fore, they cannot be relied on. Importantly, typical pneumococcal pneumonia (sudden onset, high fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, lobar infi ltrates, leucocytosis) is only one part of the range of bacterial pneumonia.31

White-blood-cell count and concentrations in serum of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are variables studied widely in children and adults with community-acquired pneumonia. In general, these biomarkers are raised signifi cantly in individuals with bacterial pneumonia compared with patients with viral pneumonia (table 1),19,32–35 although none has suffi cient sensitivity or specifi city to be used in isolation. Use of procalcitonin in clinical practice to identify bacterial infection and help guide antimicrobial treatment has been the focus of many studies. This substance increases within $^ { 6 - 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ after onset of bacterial infection and halves daily when infection is controlled.34 In the context of pneumonia, concentrations of procalcitonin greater than $0 { \cdot } 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ support bacterial infection, whereas repeatedly low amounts suggest that bacterial infection is unlikely. However, the exact role of procalcitonin in management of pneumonia is still the subject of ongoing discussion and debate.35

Recommendations from the American Thoracic Society are that diagnosis of pneumonia should be made on the basis of chest radiography.36 Interstitial infi ltrates on chest radiographs are generally believed to suggest a viral cause of pneumonia and alveolar infi ltrates to indicate a bacterial cause (fi gure 2). However, bacteria and viruses alone or together can induce a broad range of chest radiographic changes, and alterations are only helpful in specifi c cases to confi rm a microbial cause of pneumonia. In one study, bacterial infection was noted in 97 $( 7 1 \% )$ of 137 children with alveolar infi ltrates, whereas 97 $( 7 2 \% )$ of 134 with bacterial pneumonia had alveolar infi ltrates.33 In children with viral pneumonia, 40 $( 4 9 \% )$ had alveolar changes. Of 85 children with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, alveolar infi ltrates were recorded in 77 $( 9 1 \% )$ and interstitial infi ltrates alone in eight $( 9 \% )$ .37 Multilobe disease in various cases of viral pneumonia was reported in half of 88 adults with community-acquired pneumonia.19 Thoracic CT indicated tree-bud opacities, multifocal consolidations, and ground-glass opacities in adults with viral pneumonia without any evidence of possible concomitant bacterial infection; however, a viral cause was never suggested by the radiologists.38

Rhinovirus infections are from $^ { 1 9 8 7 }$ to 2006; other respiratory virus infections are from 1980 to 1999. Modifi ed from reference 51, with permission of John Wiley and Sons.

Intuitively, bacterial pneumonia should respond to appropriate antibacterial treatment but viral pneumonia should not. In a study of 153 children admitted with community-acquired pneumonia, median duration of fever was $1 4 \ \mathrm { h }$ after onset of antibiotic treatment.39 No diff erence was recorded between those diagnosed with viral and bacterial pneumonia. However, children with mixed viral and bacterial infections became afebrile over a longer period. Undetected bacterial co-infection probably accounts for the response to antibacterial treatment in patients with apparent viral pneumonia.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a dynamic situation. Biomarkers and infi ltrates on chest radiographs are only snapshots of this active state. Findings of follow-up studies, after $1 2 { - } 2 4 \ \mathrm { h }$ , might be totally diff erent.

# Causes of viral pneumonia Paediatric studies

We identifi ed nine studies of community-acquired pneumonia $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { n = 4 2 7 9 }$ episodes) in which the viral cause had been searched for by PCR. In most of these investigations, virus culture and antigen detection were also used.21,30,40–46 Seven studies were undertaken in developed countries and two in developing countries. Evidence of viral infection was recorded in $4 9 \%$ (range 43–67) of cases. Prevalence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with respiratory syncytial virus $( 1 1 \% )$ , infl uenza viruses $( 1 0 \% )$ , parainfl uenza viruses $( 8 \% )$ , and adenovirus $( 3 \% )$ was similar to that reported in studies in which only conventional diagnostic approaches were used.1,2 Exact numbers of diff erent viruses are diffi cult to compare from one study to another because several techniques were applied. When serological assays alone were used, evidence of a viral cause was obtained in $2 0 { - } 4 3 \%$ of children with community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus was dominant.47–50 PCR has increased detection of rhinoviruses $( 1 8 \% )$ and enteroviruses $( 7 \% )$ Of newly described viruses, human bocavirus was recorded in $5 \%$ of cases and human metapneumovirus in $8 \%$ . Coronaviruses were seen in 22 $( 7 \% )$ of 338 children in one study.41 In a 3-year prospective study in Finland, the overall probable cause of pneumonia was recorded in $8 5 \%$ of children, with bacterial infection in $5 3 \%$ and viral infection in $6 2 \%$ .30 The most comprehensive study from a virological perspective searched for 14 viruses in 338 children with pneumonia over a 2-year period.41 Prevalence of viral infection was $67 \%$ , with respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, human bocavirus, human meta pneumo virus, and parainfl uenza viruses being the most common agents.

Many researchers have focused on the role of single respiratory viruses as a cause of childhood communityacquired pneumonia or have studied sole virus infections and looked for pneumonia in their clinical profi les (table 2). Globally, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be the major causative viral agent of pneumonia in children and could be the predominant viral cause of severe pneumonia in this population.52,53 With the advent of PCR techniques, rhinoviruses have been detected increasingly in childhood pneumonia.54 The clinical profi le of 643 rhinovirus infections in children admitted to hospital has been reported in seven studies,55–61 and 11– $. 5 3 \%$ had pneumonia. However, the role of rhinoviruses in pneumonia is still questioned because of the frequent detection of rhinoviruses in asymptomatic individuals (mean prevalence $1 5 \%$ ), strikingly more than for other respiratory viruses (prevalence $1 - 5 \% )$ .62 Jartti and colleagues suggested that PCR is likely to detect a true but asymptomatic infection.62 A diffi culty with rhinoviruses is the paucity of serological tests to verify acute infection. In immunocompetent individuals, rhinoviral clearance after symptomatic infection is rapid (average 1–3 weeks).18

Pneumonia was diagnosed in $10 \%$ of children admitted with acute human metapneumovirus respiratory infection,63–66 with the highest prevalence $( 4 4 \% )$ in infants younger than 12 months.66 It has also been recorded in $1 1 - 7 5 \%$ of children with human bocavirus infection.67 In a study from Thailand of infants younger than 5 years admitted with pneumonia, human bocavirus was the third most prevalent agent detected, after rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, accounting for $12 \%$ of all cases.68 Although the role of human bocavirus in pneumonia is still being clarifi ed, serological evidence suggests it is a cause of human infection. With a novel IgM and IgG enzyme immunoassay, $9 6 \%$ of children with a high load of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates and $9 2 \%$ of wheezy children with viraemia had diagnostic seroresponses.69 Human bocavirus was identifi ed serologically in 12 $( 1 2 \% )$ of 101 children with community-acquired pneumonia in Italy.70

Although prevalence of adenovirus-associated pneumonia is fairly low (range $2 - 1 2 \%$ ), this type of infection is important to recognise because it might induce severe and fatal necrotising pneumonia (especially serotypes 3, 7, and 14).30,40–46,71 In China, adenovirus DNA was detected in $9 \%$ of post-mortem pulmonary tissue specimens from 175 children with fatal pneumonia.72 Of note, PCR is substantially more sensitive for identifi cation of adenovirus than is antigen detection.73

Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, and newly discovered types NL63 and HKU1, have been linked to community-acquired pneumonia in children.74,75 Infection with human coronavirus was detected in $3 \%$ of children and adolescents in a large pneumonia study in Thailand.76

# Research in adults

We identifi ed ten studies of adults with communityacquired pneumonia $\scriptstyle ( 1 = 2 9 1 0$ episodes) in which PCR was used to test for respiratory viruses. Evidence of viral infection was detected in $2 2 \%$ of cases.19,20,77–85 In most of these studies, a comprehensive array of conventional virological methods were also implemented to better defi ne the role of viruses in adults with communityacquired pneumonia. Similar to fi ndings of paediatric studies, prevalence of infection with infl uenza viruses $( 8 \% )$ , respiratory syncytial virus $( 3 \% )$ , parainfl uenza viruses $( 2 \% )$ , and adenovirus $( 2 \% )$ is comparable with values recorded with conventional diagnostic methods alone.5,36 Serological techniques only were used in four studies; evidence of viral community-acquired pneumonia was noted in $1 0 { - } 2 3 \%$ of patients.86–89 Use of PCR has augmented detection of viruses that are diffi cult to identify with conventional methods, including rhinoviruses $( 6 \% )$ , human coronaviruses $( 5 \% )$ , and human metapneumovirus $( 1 \% )$ . As a result, overall prevalence of respiratory viral infection in PCR studies $( 1 5 - 5 6 \% )$ is generally higher than for studies in which PCR was not implemented. With a full set of tests, fi ndings of three reports suggest that a third of adult cases of community-acquired pneumonia are associated with viral infection.19,20,85

Other researchers have focused on the role of specifi c respiratory viruses in adults with community-acquired pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus is recognised increasingly as a cause of illness in adults,90 and roughly $2 - 9 \%$ of elderly patients admitted with pneumonia in the USA have infection associated with this virus.91 Infections with respiratory syncytial virus are linked to substantial mortality.92 Several outbreaks of severe respiratory disease (including fatal pneumonia) in elderly residents of nursing homes have been associated with rhinoviruses.93,94 Adenoviruses have been implicated in $90 \%$ of pneumoniarelated admissions in basic military trainees.95 An outbreak of pneumonia associated with adenovirus serotype 14 has been reported.96 When searched for systematically, coronaviruses have been detected in samples from a small proportion $( 2 \mathrm { - } 6 \% )$ of adults with pneumonia.76,97 These patients had clinical illnesses indistinguishable from those in individuals with community-acquired pneumonia associated with other micro organisms. $2 \%$ of asymptomatic controls also had human coronavirus infection.76

Infections with human metapneumovirus arise throughout adulthood. Outbreaks of this viral infection associated with fatal outcome have been reported from long-term care facilities.98,99 Of patients admitted with human metapneumovirus infection, $2 7 \%$ had chest radiographic infi ltrates, $12 \%$ required ventilatory support, and $7 \%$ died.100 Human bocavirus is an uncommon cause of pneumonia in adults. As part of a surveillance project in Thailand, this virus was detected in fi ve $( 1 \% )$ of 667 adults (age 20 years or older) admitted with pneumonia and in one of 126 $( 1 \% )$ controls without febrile or respiratory illness.68

# Pneumonia associated with SARS, avian infl uenza, and 2009 pandemic infl uenza

During 2002 and 2003, the SARS coronavirus caused severe respiratory infection in more than 8000 people and led to 774 deaths. Up to a third of patients with SARS became critically ill. Pneumonia with lung injury arose in about $16 \%$ of all individuals infected with the virus and in $80 \%$ of critically ill patients. By contrast with other viral pneumonias, children were fairly well protected from severe illness.101

Since November, 2003, avian infl uenza A (H5N1) virus has caused more than 450 human infections, with a case-fatality proportion of about $60 \%$ . Multiorgan failure usually develops within 1 week from onset of illness, with lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and raised concentrations of aminotransferase and creatinine. Almost all patients with avian infl uenza develop pneumonia. Cause of death is most typically progressive respiratory failure.102

Since March, 2009, pandemic infl uenza A (H1N1) virus has spread in more than 200 countries over the world, causing about 18 000 deaths. In the USA alone, more than 59 million people have been infected.103 In Australia, the rate of admission was 23 per 100 000 population. Critical illness arose most commonly in adults with a median age of 40 years and has been rare in those older than 65 years.103–105 Half of patients with critical illness had viral pneumonitis or acute respiratory distress syndrome.103,106 In Germany, pneumonia was diagnosed in 275 $( 0 \cdot 7 \% )$ of 40 729 patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection; half of these were admitted.107 In the UK, 102 $( 2 9 \% )$ of 349 patients with chest radiographs had fi ndings consistent with pneumonia. Median age of patients with pneumonia was 26 years.108 Poor outcomes from H1N1 virus infection have been recorded in pregnant women, indigenous populations, and individuals with substantial obesity or serious comorbidities.

Chest radiographic infi ltrates in SARS, H5N1, and H1N1 infections were most usually interstitial, patchy, and bilateral.109

# Detection of several viruses

In 1997, Drews and colleagues110 reviewed eight studies of a total of 1341 cases of respiratory viral infection detected mostly with conventional techniques. These researchers noted dual viral infection in 67 $( 5 \% )$ cases. Detection of several viruses in a fairly high proportion of cases has been a feature of pneumonia aetiological studies in which PCR was used. In particular, for childhood pneumonia, two or three viruses have been detected in $1 0 { - } 2 0 \%$ of children.21,30,40–46 Specifi cally, human bocavirus is detected frequently in association with other respiratory viruses.67–69 In a Thai pneumonia study, 40 $( 9 1 \% )$ of 44 children younger than 5 years with human bocavirus infections had co-infection with other viruses.68 The combination of human bocavirus and rhinovirus was the most typical dual infection. In a comprehensive virological study of childhood pneumonia, two or more viruses were detected in 61 $( 1 8 \% )$ of 338 pneumonia episodes, and three viruses were recorded in nine cases.41 Human bocavirus was associated with other viruses in 33 $( 6 9 \% )$ of 48 episodes, followed by infl uenza viruses (13/25; $5 2 \%$ ) and respiratory syncytial virus $( 3 4 / 6 7 ; 5 1 \% )$ . In another study, $64 \%$ of children with human bocavirus infection and co-infection with another virus had serological evidence of acute human bocavirus infection.69

The clinical relevance of detection of several viruses in pneumonia, and the association with severe illness, is uncertain.111–113 Viral-viral interaction in vivo is poorly understood. Viruses might interact indirectly or directly, resulting in complementation or inhibition. Children with pneumonia caused by co-infection with human bocavirus and other viruses have more wheezing than with viral pneumonia associated with a sole pathogen.69 In one study, viral co-infections were associated with more severe pneumonia than were single infections, when rates of admission were looked at.41

# Viral-bacterial co-infection

Interest has grown with respect to the interaction of bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Evidence from cell culture, ecological, post-mortem, and clinical studies support this area of interest. A favoured hypothesis is that viral infection is followed by secondary bacterial infection. Researchers who reassessed data from the infl uenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 have suggested that most deaths during these periods probably resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.114 This fi nding contrasts with avian H5N1-associated pneumonia, which seems to be a primarily viral infection.102 In patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection, secondary bacterial infection developed in $4 - 2 4 \%$ of cases.103,106,115

Evidence of probable mixed viral-bacterial infection has been recorded in up to $45 \%$ of cases of communityacquired pneumonia in children.21,30,40–46 Not surprisingly, the most typical combination is Streptococcus pneumoniae with various respiratory viruses. In developing countries, both viruses and bacteria have been detected directly in lung aspirate samples from children with pneumonia.22 In a study from The Gambia, 45 of 74 children had evidence of pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia and 15 $( 3 3 \% )$ of these also had evidence of a respiratory virus infection, shown by virus culture or serological tests.116 In a study from Nigeria,117 virological analysis was done in 122 children with community-acquired pneumonia. 61 $( 5 0 \% )$ had evidence of viral infection and, of those, ten $( 1 6 \% )$ also had blood cultures positive for bacteria, most usually Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, ten $( 1 6 \% )$ of 62 cases with measles-associated community-acquired pneumonia had bacteraemia.117

Mixed viral-bacterial infections in adults with community-acquired pneumonia seem to be reported less frequently than those in children.19,20,77–85 In one study, both viral and bacterial pathogens were noted in 35 $( 1 4 \% )$ of 242 cases.84 In another investigation, evidence of mixed viral and bacterial infections was reported in 45 $( 1 5 \% )$ of 304 patients (median age 70 years). The most frequent combinations were rhinovirus plus Strep pneumoniae and infl uenza A plus Strep pneumoniae.19 Undoubtedly, detection of several pathogens will be noted more frequently as more elaborate diagnostic tests are used as

part of pneumonia aetiological studies. Presuming that viral infection precedes bacterial infection, we are likely to continue underestimating the true incidence of viralbacterial co-infection because of diffi culties detecting the earlier infection.

Evidence, albeit sparse, suggests that mixed infections could induce a more severe infl ammatory and clinical disease than individual bacterial or viral infections.19,84,118 Concomitant infl uenza virus and Staph aureus infection can cause severe fatal pneumonia in children and adults.119–121 Moreover, in one pneumonia study, half of children with treatment failure had evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection.39 Similarly, in adults, rhinoviruspneumococcal and infl uenza-bacterial pneumonia co-infections are associated with severe pneumonia and raised mortality.19,84,121 Detection of Strep pneumoniae in the nasopharynx of patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection predicted severe disease outcome.122

# Pathology

Post-mortem studies provide direct evidence for a viral cause of pneumonia and descriptions of characteristics of lung histopathology. Many diff erent respiratory viruses have been detected in lung tissue in case reports or in larger series.

In 200 children who died from serious respiratory infections in Brazil, use of immunohistochemical techniques aided detection of viruses in lung tissue from 53 $( 3 4 \% )$ with bronchopneumonia and 18 $( 4 2 \% )$ with interstitial pneumonitis, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus, infl uenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, and parainfl uenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3.123 In another study from Mexico, PCR detected respiratory syncytial virus in lung tissue from 29 $( 3 0 \% )$ of 98 children who died from pneumonia.124 Of archived lung tissue from 175 children who died of pneumonia in south China, 20 samples had adenovirus detected by PCR or by immunohistochemistry.72 Rhinovirus infection of the lung has also been shown by histopathology.125

The nature of histopathological changes in viral pneumonia varies, possibly an indication of diff erences in viral infections and comorbidity. Generally, interstitial pneumonitis with lymphocytic infi ltrations is seen in viral pneumonitis.123 In fatal cases of pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection, post-mortem evidence shows infection of both bronchial and alveolar epithelium.126 Most cells around the bronchioles and in the alveolar interstitium were alveolar macrophages and monocytes, and CD3- positive lymphocytes were also seen frequently around bronchioles. In rhinovirus pneumonia, hyperplasia and desquamation of alveolar-lining cells and immunohistochemical localisation of rhinoviral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages were seen.125 In fatal cases of human metapneumovirus pneumonia, pathological analysis indicated bilateral haemorrhagic bronchopneumonia.127

Histopathological fi ndings in fatal cases of SARS and avian H5N1 infection are quite similar and have been characterised by diff use alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, oedema, and hyaline-membrane formation.128,129 Diff use alveolar damage has also been recorded in the lungs of people who died of 2009 pandemic H1N1 infections (fi gure 3). Furthermore, necrotising bronchiolitis, diff use alveolar damage with alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar septal oedema, hyaline membranes, hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes, and necrosis of bronchiolar walls have been noted.130,131 Histopathological evidence of bacterial co-infection was reported in 29 of 100 fatal H1N1 cases.132

# Management

Do all patients with community-acquired pneumonia, including those with evidence of viral infection, need to be treated with antibiotics? To date, no clear consensus exists on this issue. Some experts recommend that all patients with pneumonia should receive antibiotic treatment, because exclusion of the presence of bacterial infection is impossible. Recommendations of the British Thoracic Society are that antibiotic treatment can be withheld in young children with mild illness in whom viral infection is likely.1 As far as we know, only one randomised placebo-controlled study has been done to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in childhood community-acquired pneumonia.133 $\mathrm { ~ I n ~ } 1 3 6$ children, no clinically signifi cant effi cacy of antibiotics was recorded. Most study children had fairly mild disease and the investigation was undertaken during an epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus, so most participants probably had pneumonia caused by this virus. Further randomised placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia are unlikely to happen because of ethical concerns.

Opportunities are currently limited in clinical practice for use of antivirals in the treatment of pneumonia (table 3).134 Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, were developed during the 1990s and now have established roles in early treatment of infl uenza A and B infections. In children and adults, neuraminidase inhibitors reduce median time to resolution of symptoms by 0·5–2·5 days when administered within $4 8 \mathrm { { h } }$ of onset of symptoms.135 Importantly, early use of neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce development of complications such as pneumonia.136 The Infectious Diseases Society of America extends treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors to admitted infl uenza patients whose onset of symptoms is more than 48 h before presentation.137 Selection of the most appropriate antiviral to treat infl uenza should be made on the basis of relevant susceptibility data. Before emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, the seasonal H1N1 virus developed resistance to oseltamivir, and treatment with either zanamivir or amantadine or rimantidine was recommended, whereas the seasonal H3N2 virus was resistant to amantadine and rimantidine. If subtype information is unavailable, zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine is recommended.137 The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus remains susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and oseltamivir has been used widely for treatment of pneumonia caused by this virus. Although resistance to oseltamivir has been reported in people with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infection, it has been largely restricted to immunocompromised individuals.103 All isolates are still susceptible to zanamivir. Intravenous use of peramivir or zanamivir could be lifesaving in critically ill patients with infl uenza.138,139

Experience with antivirals for community-acquired pneumonia caused by viruses other than infl uenza is scarce, with existing knowledge mainly from case reports and some treatment studies in immunosuppressed patients. Ribavirin has a broad antiviral range, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfl uenza and infl uenza viruses.140 Effi cacy of ribavirin aerosol treatment for bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection is modest at best. Intravenous ribavirin could be considered for treatment of severe pneumonia caused by infection with respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, or parainfl uenza virus, on the basis of experience in immunosuppressed patients.141

New antiviral agents are in development for respiratory syncytial virus infection, including small interfering RNAs.142 In several case studies of immunocompromised patients, clinical effi cacy of cidofovir has been shown for severe adenovirus pneumonia.143 Cidofovir should be considered for treatment of new adenovirus subtype 14 pneumonia. Researchers reported successful manage ment of human metapneumovirus pneumonia with a combination of intravenous ribavirin and immuno globulin.144 Varicella pneumonia should be treated with aciclovir.145

Use of corticosteroids for treatment of viral communityacquired pneumonia is controversial and can vary according to the causative virus. The ineff ectiveness of these agents for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections is well established.146 For management of SARS, inconclusive results were reported in 26 treatment studies, and possible harm was indicated in four trials.147 High-dose corticosteroids were administered to a third of patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infection,148 but use of these agents is not recommended because of prolonged viral shedding in seasonal infl uenza and increased mortality in avian H5N1 and, possibly, 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infections.103 On the other hand, some data suggest that corticosteroids can augment outcome of pneumonia caused by infection with varicella-zoster virus (in combination with aciclovir) and hantavirus.149

# Prevention

Possibilities to prevent viral community-acquired pneumonia are limited. Infl uenza vaccines have been used since the mid 1940s and they now have an established role in prevention of infl uenza A and B virus infections. Importantly, inactivated infl uenza vaccine is eff ective in young children, including those younger than 2 years.150 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a monovalent vaccine against the virus was developed.103 Its active use could have played a part in the course of the initial pandemic wave in some countries—eg, in Finland, only 44 fatal cases were recorded. In addition to vaccines, infl uenza A and B virus infections can be prevented by prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors.137 Severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in high-risk neonates have been prevented successfully with palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, which is administered during a respiratory syncytial virus epidemic.151 This agent has been shown to prevent admissions related to respiratory syncytial virus by $5 0 \%$ in premature infants. Since the 1960s, several types of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus have been developed without success. Live-attenuated vaccines produced by reverse genetics are now in clinical studies.142 Pneumonia caused by adenovirus types 4 and 7 has been prevented in military trainees by an oral vaccine, with $9 5 \%$ effi cacy.

Unfortunately, confl ict over the manufacturing process stopped production in 1996.95 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was shown to prevent a third of viral pneumonia cases in a study in South Africa, most probably by prevention of superimposed bacterial co-infections.152

# Future research

Despite many advances, further studies are still needed to better understand the role of viruses in the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Increased availability of molecular diagnostic methods enables us to evaluate our understanding of viral pneumonia and to reassess all existing dogma. Further clarifi cation is needed of the role of bacterial-viral interaction in the pathogenesis of pneumonia and of the importance of viruses as pneumonia pathogens in the world after widespread implementation of $H$ infl uenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Also, examination of regional diff erences in causes of pneumonia is needed urgently, particularly to obtain additional data from developing countries. Detailed understanding of the viral cause of community-acquired pneumonia will guide antiviral drug and vaccine developments.
