## Topic selection(Build PICO)

### Basic Principles

1. Importance
   1. Significant clinical influence

   2. Controversy
      1. Contradictions exist among different research findings
      2. Significant variations in conclusions from clinical practice
      3. Low reliability of results from individual independent studies

2. Novelty
   1. Unexplored content and directions
   2. For previously studied content, analysis from new perspectives or updates is required
   3. For ongoing research by others, analysis from different perspectives is needed

3. Feasibility
   1. The research topic has a sufficient number of primary studies
   2. The research topic has clearly defined study subjects and objectives
   3. The primary studies corresponding to the research topic have explicit research methods and clear outcome measures
   4. Questions that can yield definitive conclusions
